# token-invalidator

This repo is so I can easily invalidate discord tokens.

If you or a loved one received an email from discord saying your token was exposed/found here, you likely ran malware or got phished.
Please reinstall your Operating System (Windows), and change **all** of your passwords.

Don't shoot the messager :^)

Thanks.
